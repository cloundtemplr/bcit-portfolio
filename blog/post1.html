            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>HTML, which stands for "Hypertext Markup Language," is the standard markup language used to create webpages and structure their content on the World Wide Web. HTML is not a programming language; instead, it is a markup language that defines the structure and elements of a webpage. Here are some key points about HTML:</p>
                
                <li>Structure: HTML provides a way to structure the content of a webpage using a system of elements and tags. These elements define various parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.</li>
                
                <li>Markup: HTML uses a set of predefined tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to mark or enclose different types of content. Tags are used to define the beginning and end of elements, and they often come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
                
                <li>Hierarchy: HTML elements can be nested inside one another, creating a hierarchical structure for organizing content. This hierarchy is crucial for defining the relationships between different parts of a webpage.</li>
                
                <li>Semantic Meaning: HTML elements are designed to convey the semantic meaning of content. 
                
                <li>Evolution: HTML has gone through various versions, with HTML5 being the latest major version as of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021. HTML5 introduced many new features and elements, including support for multimedia, form validation, and improved semantics.</li>
                
                <p>HTML serves as the foundation for web development. It is often used in conjunction with other web technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity to create dynamic and visually appealing web applications. Web developers use HTML to structure the content of webpages and make them accessible and functional for users on the internet.</li>
