            <h3>SQL</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is primarily used for tasks related to database management, data retrieval, data manipulation, and data definition. It provides a standardized way to interact with and operate on relational databases. Here are some key aspects of SQL:</p>
                
                <li>Relational Databases: SQL is most commonly associated with relational database management systems (RDBMS), which are used to store and manage structured data in tables with predefined schemas. Examples of popular RDBMS systems that use SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.</li>
                
                <li>Data Querying: SQL is used to retrieve data from a database by writing queries. SQL queries can specify the data to retrieve, filter, sort, and group the results, making it a powerful tool for data retrieval.</li>
                
                <li>Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands for manipulating data in a database, including adding, updating, and deleting records. These commands are often referred to as Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.</li>
                
                <li>Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The interpreter determines the data type at runtime, making Python flexible and adaptable.</li>
                
                <li>Data Definition: SQL allows you to define and modify the structure of a database, including creating tables, specifying constraints, and altering the schema. These commands are known as Data Definition Language (DDL) statements.</li>
                <li>Data Integrity: SQL supports data integrity through the use of constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints. These constraints help ensure data accuracy and consistency.</li>
                <li>Transactions: SQL supports transactions, which are sequences of one or more SQL statements that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of database operations.</li>
                <li>Security: SQL databases often include features for user authentication and authorization, allowing database administrators to control who can access and manipulate the data.</li>
                <li>Stored Procedures and Functions: SQL allows you to define and execute stored procedures and functions within the database. These are reusable blocks of SQL code that can perform complex operations.</li>
                <li>Views: SQL enables the creation of virtual tables known as views. Views are based on the data in one or more tables and provide a way to simplify complex queries or restrict access to certain parts of the database.</li>
                <p>SQL is an essential tool for anyone working with relational databases, including database administrators, data analysts, and software developers. It provides a standardized and efficient way to interact with and manage data stored in a relational database system.</li>
